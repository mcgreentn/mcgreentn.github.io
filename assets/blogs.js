            "description": "Artificial intelligence has become a buzzword. Many people believe they know what AI is, but only a portion of them actually understand it. Just Google “AI”, and I guarantee there will be plenty of nonsense out there to read, like this article. But there is enormous potential in using AI to solve real-world problems for everyday people. In this post, I want to explain a really cool application for AI that I’ve dedicated the past few years of my life researching: AI as a teacher.",

            "description": "The Generative Design in Minecraft Competition is designed to facilitate the exploration of new possibilities in the realm of 3-dimensional world generation and manipulation. The aim of this competition is to advance the state of the art of procedural generation of settlements and game content. The goal is to be able to produce Minecraft settlements of comparable quality to those produced by groups of human builders (see the section on Good Human Examples). In other words, developing an AI to build something that we consider functional AND pretty to look at.",

I chose Breath of the Wild, as its a game I've been dying to play since it came out. I thought I'd post that write-up on the blog, both for those who have played Zelda and want a good discussion, and those who have yet to play it and have no idea what the hype is about.",

Naturally there are more obscure roles that don't fit into these categories. We suggested a new role that has not been proposed yet: that of teacher. The problem is: If I have a game, can I generate a way to teach you, the player, how to play it?",

Gamify education. Make it easy to see that you took education and made a game out of it, like what we did with Edu-Venture. The second is to hide the education deep under layers, so the player has no idea that they were ever learning in the first place.",
